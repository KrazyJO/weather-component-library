# React Component Library + TypeScript + Vite

## Test setting up a component library
This project is a test for being able to deploy a component library with react + vite + typescript.

***hint: it works fine ;)***

This is done with [this](https://dev.to/receter/how-to-create-a-react-component-library-using-vites-library-mode-4lma) nice tutorial.


## node version manager
In this repository is a file called `.nvmrc`. This file contains the node version this project is build with.
You can use the command `nvm use` in the root directory of this project to switch to the used version.
To archive this, `nvm` needs to be installed. The installation instructions for Mac are [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
